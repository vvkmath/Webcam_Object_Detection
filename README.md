# Webcam_Object_Detection
Use KNN Transfer learning to detect objects on webcam

The purpose of this project is to build an app using Tensorflow.js to train a ML model to classify three objects. It also includes a no action class, which does not recognize any of the three objects. Using a pre-trained ML model, the KNN uses the activations representing the nearest neighbors to classify an object.
